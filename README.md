## Motivation & Goals

I started this project because I wanted a tool that would make certain tasks easier when managing my personal website. I wanted to be able to easily search pelican content and metadata, easily create and edit content without remembering the exact file path, manage resources outside of the traditional role of pelican (images, documents).
